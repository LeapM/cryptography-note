# block cipher is the horse power

block cipher built by iteration

1. key extension function
2. round function

**PRP**(Psudo Random Permutation) 3DES, AES. is essential block cipher

Functioally any PRP is also a PRF *A PRP is a PRF where X=Y and is efficiently invertible*

## DES data encryption standardard
* 1997 DES broken by exhaustive search
* 2000 AES to repalce DES

**Feistel Network**

general method for building inverible function (block ciphers) from arbitrary functions.

used in many block cyhper but not in AES
